## About Me

Multidisciplinary Mechanical and Biomedical Engineer with hands-on experience in the design, development, and validation of medical and IoT devices. I specialize in translating concepts into manufacturable, compliant products under ISO 13485 and MDR standards.

I’m particularly passionate about **wearable technologies and digital health innovations** that improve patient outcomes.


##  Featured Projects
Below is a list of projects that I have worked with since the start of my Bacherlor's program along with description and links.

###  Personalized Hand Brace with Pressure Sensors
